## Projects

In this section, showcase your projects. Provide a brief description of each project, along with any relevant details such as the technologies used, your role in the project, and the project's impact or outcome. If possible, include links to live demos, deployed websites, or GitHub repositories.

Here are a few examples of how you can structure your project descriptions:

### Project 1: Project Name

- Technologies Used: List the programming languages, frameworks, libraries, or tools used in the project.
- My Role: Describe your contribution to the project and your responsibilities.
- Link: Provide a link to the project's live demo, deployed website, or GitHub repository.

Repeat this structure for each project you want to showcase.

Be honest about your skill levels and use appropriate categorization if needed (e.g., beginner, intermediate, advanced).
